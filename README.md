Fibonacci sequence project to practice recursion. Project is from the Odin Project. Find here (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/recursion)

reflection:

Method without recursion can be used to return whole sequence up to a certain number. You can get specific places by saving it into a variable then finding the specific spot you're looking for.

Method with recursion only gives you the value of the number at a specific spot.  Some extra work is required after the fact to give you an array of all numbers up to a certain spot.
